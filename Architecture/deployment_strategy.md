# Deployment Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Fish Watch system. It describes the deployment environments, deployment process, and considerations for deploying and managing the system.

## Deployment Environments

### Development Environment

- **Description**: Used by developers for local development and testing.
- **Components**: All system components deployed locally on developer machines.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates rapid development and debugging of new features.

### Staging Environment

- **Description**: A replica of the production environment for pre-production testing.
- **Components**: Deployed on dedicated staging servers or cloud instances.
- **Purpose**: Allows testing of new features, updates, and configurations before deployment to production.

### Production Environment

- **Description**: The live environment where the system is accessible to users.
- **Components**: Deployed on production servers or cloud instances.
- **Purpose**: Hosts the fully operational Fish Watch system for use by fish farmers and other stakeholders.

## Deployment Process

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **Description**: Utilizes automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying code changes.
- **Tools**: GitLab CI/CD.
- **Process**:
  1. Developers push code changes to version control (e.g., GitLab).
  2. CI/CD pipeline triggers automated tests (unit tests, integration tests).
  3. Upon successful testing, the pipeline deploys changes to the appropriate environment (development, staging, or production).

### Deployment Workflow

- **Description**: Defines the workflow for deploying changes to each environment.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Development**: Changes are deployed to the development environment for initial testing and review by developers.
  2. **Staging**: Tested changes are promoted to the staging environment for further testing by QA and stakeholders.
  3. **Production**: Approved changes are deployed to the production environment for public access.

## Considerations

### Scalability

- **Description**: Ensure the deployment architecture is scalable to handle increasing user load and data volume.
- **Strategies**: Horizontal scaling using load balancers and auto-scaling groups in cloud environments.

### High Availability

- **Description**: Minimize downtime and ensure continuous availability of the Fish Watch system.
- **Strategies**: Implement redundant components, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Description**: Monitor system performance, health, and security in real-time.
- **Tools**: Prometheus for monitoring, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and log analysis.

## Conclusion

The deployment strategy outlined in this document ensures the efficient and reliable deployment of the Fish Watch system across development, staging, and production environments. By leveraging CI/CD practices and considering scalability, high availability, and monitoring, the system can meet the needs of users and stakeholders while maintaining operational excellence.
