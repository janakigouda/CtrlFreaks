# Security Architecture

## Introduction

This document outlines the security architecture of the Fish Watch system. It describes the security measures and best practices implemented to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Security Measures

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Description**: Authenticate users and authorize access to system resources based on user roles and permissions.
- **Implementation**: Utilize authentication protocols such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.
- **Benefits**: Ensures only authenticated and authorized users can access system resources and perform actions.

### Encryption

- **Description**: Protect data confidentiality by encrypting sensitive information at rest and in transit.
- **Implementation**: Use SSL/TLS encryption for securing data transmission over the network and implement encryption mechanisms for data stored in databases and file systems.
- **Benefits**: Prevents unauthorized access to data and ensures confidentiality even if data is intercepted or compromised.

### Security Auditing and Logging

- **Description**: Monitor system activity, track user actions, and log security events for auditing and compliance purposes.
- **Implementation**: Integrate logging frameworks and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to capture and analyze security-related events.
- **Benefits**: Provides visibility into system activity, facilitates incident response and forensic analysis, and supports regulatory compliance requirements.

## Compliance and Regulations

### GDPR Compliance

- **Description**: Ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect user privacy and data rights.
- **Implementation**: Implement privacy by design principles, obtain user consent for data processing, and implement data protection measures such as anonymization and pseudonymization.
- **Benefits**: Demonstrates commitment to protecting user privacy and mitigates risks of fines and penalties for non-compliance.

## Conclusion

The security architecture outlined in this document provides a comprehensive framework for protecting the Fish Watch system against security threats and vulnerabilities. By implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, encryption protocols, security auditing and logging, and compliance measures, the system can maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and availability while ensuring regulatory compliance and user trust.
