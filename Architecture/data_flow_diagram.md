# Data Flow Diagram

## Data Sources and Sinks

### Data Sources

1. **Weather APIs**: External APIs such as OpenWeatherMap or AccuWeather provide weather data, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation forecasts.
2. **Water Quality Monitoring Sensors**: Sensors and devices measure water pH levels and other environmental parameters in fish farms.

### Data Sinks

1. **Data Acquisition Component**: Collects weather data from Weather APIs and water pH level data from water quality monitoring sensors.
2. **Fish Health Monitoring Component**: Integrates with fish health monitoring devices to gather health metrics such as oxygen levels, ammonia levels, and temperature.
3. **Data Processing and Analysis Component**: Processes and analyzes weather and water data, implementing machine learning algorithms and storing historical data in MongoDB.

## Data Flow Paths

1. **Weather Data Flow**:
   - Weather data is collected from external APIs and sent to the Data Acquisition component.
   - The Data Acquisition component processes weather data and forwards it to the Data Processing and Analysis component.
   - Processed weather data is stored in MongoDB for further analysis and recommendation generation.

2. **Water Data Flow**:
   - Water pH level data is gathered from water quality monitoring sensors and transmitted to the Data Acquisition component.
   - The Data Acquisition component preprocesses water data and sends it to the Data Processing and Analysis component.
   - Processed water data is stored in MongoDB for correlation with other environmental parameters.

3. **Fish Health Data Flow**:
   - Health metrics from fish health monitoring devices are captured by the Fish Health Monitoring component.
   - The Fish Health Monitoring component interfaces with the Data Processing and Analysis component to integrate health metrics with weather and water data.
   - Integrated health metrics are stored in MongoDB for analysis and recommendation generation.

## Data Transformation

- Data transformations occur at various stages of the data flow to preprocess, enrich, and aggregate data for analysis and recommendation generation.
- Examples include normalizing weather data, aggregating water pH level readings, and integrating health metrics with environmental parameters.

## Data Storage

- Processed data is stored in MongoDB, providing a scalable and flexible solution for storing historical data and training datasets for machine learning algorithms.

## Conclusion

The data flow diagram provides a comprehensive visualization of how data moves through the Fish Watch system, from its sources to its destinations. Understanding the data flow paths and transformations is essential for designing robust data pipelines and ensuring the integrity and reliability of data-driven insights.
