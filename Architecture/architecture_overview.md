# Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the Fish Watch system. It outlines the goals, design principles, main components, component relationships, and architecture patterns used in the system.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of the Fish Watch system are to enhance fish farm productivity, optimize harvest yields, and improve monitoring capabilities. Specifically, the system aims to:

- Increase fish farm productivity by X%
- Optimize harvest yields through data-driven insights
- Improve monitoring capabilities to ensure fish health and environmental conditions

## Design Principles

The architecture of the Fish Watch system is guided by the following design principles:

1. **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle increasing data volume and user traffic without compromising performance.
2. **Modularity**: Components should be modular and loosely coupled to facilitate flexibility and ease of maintenance.
3. **Security**: Robust security measures should be implemented to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Maintainability**: The system should be designed with maintainability in mind to facilitate future updates and enhancements.

## High-level Components

The Fish Watch system consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Responsible for collecting weather data from external APIs such as OpenWeatherMap or AccuWeather, and water pH level data using water quality monitoring sensors.
2. **Fish Health Monitoring**: Integrates with fish health monitoring devices or sensors to measure parameters like oxygen levels, ammonia levels, and temperature.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Develops a recommendation engine that suggests suitable fish farming practices based on weather conditions, water pH levels, and fish health metrics.
4. **Data Processing and Analysis**: Utilizes backend servers to process and analyze weather and water data, implementing machine learning algorithms and storing historical data in MongoDB.
5. **Alerting System**: Implements a messaging service for external notifications using Amazon SNS, and in-app notifications via WebSockets.
